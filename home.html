    <h1>Part 1: Sketching & Wireframing</h1>
    <h3  class="subheadings"> Pre-Design Thinking
    </h2>
    <p>
      We chose a start-up called <a href="https://www.adynhealth.com/">Adyn</a>, a company that provides personalized birth control recommendations and health resources for understanding the contraceptive options that are available. Their intake quiz asks users about lifestyle preferences and needs, from which they initially can recommend some options. For better recommendations, they encourage users to order an at-home Birth Control Optimization Test, containing DNA and Hormone collection kits. 
    </p> <p>
      We took inspiration from the services that adyn provides to develop a mobile application that serves as an all-encompassing birth control assistant. Creating a mobile application would allow our users to access our interface from anywhere and any time. We were familiar with some applications that help monitor period cycles, though we found them to be too complicated. We wanted to break barriers to entry by creating an app that acts as a rich health resource and plain text symptom logger within the same app.
    </p>
    <h3  class="subheadings"> Sketching</h2>
    <p>Below are our very quick initial sketches:
    </p>

    <img src="sketches/2.png" alt="" class="image1">
    <img src="sketches/3.png" alt="" class="image1">
    <img src="sketches/4.png" alt="" class="image2">
    <h3  class="subheadings"> Combining Ideas into a Wireframe</h2>
    <p>We went over our hand drawn sketches and decided that the most important features of the app would be the preferences quiz;  a symptom log where users can keep track of their response to the birth control;  and a blog  where they could read content on issues surrounding contraception.
    </p><p>
      We then used balsamiq to create wireframes that represented a more unified idea of how we wanted the application to look like. 
      </p>

    </p>
    <h3  class="subheadings">  Feedback from Mockup Crit in Studio</h2>
    In studio, we received the following feedback on our mockup: 
    <ul>
      <li>Our app had a lot unnecessary text that made it appear cluttered
      </li>
      <li>The navigation bar “look[ed] weird”. It was unclear what the “a” icon stood for. 
      </li>
      <li>The Quiz interface was confusing as questions were stylized the same as the answer options. 
      </li>
      <li>Unrelated items next to each other horizontally on the home page was not very intuitive and visually unappealing. 
      </li>
      <li>The title “home” on the homescreen was not necessary. 
      </li>
      <li>There were several cases of inconsistent typography. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3  class="subheadings"> Finalized Hi-Fi Prototype
    </h2>
We made changes to our first prototype to address the above issues. We also changed the theme colors to pink and black which we thought would be more visually appealing.

<h1>Part 3: User Testing</h1>
<p>The main task we framed our test around was: to find information about birth control and use the symptom logger to log symptoms. Completing this consisted of three different subtasks: completing the birth control quiz, reading their first blog post, and recording their first symptom. We kept the task descriptions brief to see if our app could afford the completion of the task on its own. We also asked users to report how successful they were, and to rate the difficulty of the task. This scene was set for the users upon entering the test:
</p>
<img src="sketches/prompt.png" alt="" class="image3">
<h4>Task Specifics:</h4>
<img src="sketches/tasks.png" alt="" class="image3">
<!-- <h4>INtroduction:</h4> 
<p> “This is a test for an interactive phone app mock-up designed for a birth control company. 
You, the user, have never tried birth control and want to learn more about how birth control will affect you personally. You are looking for health resources and perhaps a corner for your mind to track symptoms. 
<br>
Please press "R" as you begin to ensure you land on page 1.”
</p>
<br> -->
<!-- <h4>Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Complete the birth control quiz.
  </li>
  <li>Read your first blog post. [Record success: Yes, No] [Rate difficulty: 1= difficult, 5= easy]
  </li>
<li>Record your first symptom. [Record Success: Yes, No] [Rate difficulty: 1= difficult, 5= easy]
</li>
<li>
  Answer this multiple choice question (optional):
  <p>
  <br> If you experience periods, have you ever used a phone app to log your symptoms? 
  <br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="1" id=""> yes, I still use one
  <br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="2" id=""> yes, but it was too complicated or I forgot about it
  <br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="3" id=""> no, I have some other method of regulating this
  <br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="4" id=""> prefer not to answer (please choose if you don't experience periods)
</li>
</p>
</ol> -->
<p>
Completing the quiz involved pressing the “Start Quiz” button on the home screen. We pre-filled answers to the quiz so users were not actually able to complete the quiz. They had to deduce that the interface was scrolling to find a button at the bottom to submit the quiz. Next, the users saw a screen of results matching them with birth control recommendations, as well as buttons for learning more, and navigating to other parts of the site, which were important to the next two tasks: the blog and the symptom log. The last two buttons were in a different color than the rest, mirroring the colors used in the rest of the app. 
</p> <p>
We also wanted to see how they would interact with other parts of the application so we asked them to read their first blog post and navigate to the Symptom Log and compose an entry. Completing the blog task involved either clicking on the blog button on the quiz results page or pressing the navigation bar’s blog button, and navigating to the first article with a newspaper photo and headline underneath.
</p> <p>
Completing the symptom log composing task involved navigating to the symptom log page, pressing compose, typing in the text field, and sending. We were concerned that users would take issue with the lack of distinction between the “done” top-right function to exit a text editing field and “done” to essentially send the symptom to the log, but users seemed to rely visually more on the placement and color than the actual word “done”. We also did not know if “cancel” and “done” would be noticed that they mean somewhat indistinguishable things, but again, users relied on visual placement.
</p>

  <li>What frustrated you most about this application?
  </li>
  <li>What did you like about this application?
  </li>
  <li>If you had a magic wand, which part of this app would you change?
  </li>
  <li>After using this application, do you feel any different toward your current cycle tracking methods?”

    </ul>
    <h3  class="subheadings"> Results and Analysis of User Testing</h3>
      <p> Three users completed the test:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>       User1 - user from United Kingdom, 47 years old, makes $60,000 to $80,000 per year, average technology literacy
        </li>
        <li>      User2 - user from United states, 45 years old, makes less than $20,000 per year, average technology literacy
        </li>
        <li>      User3 - user from Spain, 27 years old, makes less than $20,000 per year, high technology literacy
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      
     <h4>Task Difficulty and Success:</h4> 
      <ul>
        <li>      All 3 users reported Task 1 as very easy.
        </li>
        <li>      2 users reported Task 2 as very easy, 1 as quite difficult; Accordingly, 2 out of 3 users were sure that they completed the task correctly and 1 reported that they encountered an error or a big.
        </li>
        <li>      All users reported Task 3 as very easy; All users were sure that they completed the task correctly.
        </li>
      </ul>
<p>Our multiple choice question provided us with an interesting summary of our audience, indicating that they were evenly split between the three categories:</p>
     <img src="sketches/multiple choice question.png" alt="" class="image3"> 
<h4>Analysis:</h4>

      <p>Luckily, all three of our users were period havers as deduced by the multiple choice question results, and very interestingly, they all have different relationships to cycle tracking technology. One indicated that they do currently use a phone app to log their symptoms, one did but stopped because it was complicated or they forgot about it, and one has some other method of managing this. Although we only tested on three users, our app was tested by a more diverse group of people than we expected. They fulfilled all three of the groups we were hoping to reach with this app: people who use cycle tracking technology, people who would like to but aren’t attached to what they’ve found, and people who have perhaps never considered it. 
      </p>
        <img src="sketches/graph 2.png" alt="" class="image3">
<p>
      Overall, users did very well on the tasks. They completed tasks at their own speed, with limited hang ups. Almost all tasks were marked as “very easy.” Only one task was marked by one user as a 2 out of 5 on the rating scale [1=very difficult, 5=very easy], which was caused by confusion about Lorem Ipsum text. One user was confused when they wanted to navigate back to the quiz results page but was unable to. Sadly, we did not include a place to return to results in our prototype without redoing the quiz. One user reported unhappiness with the scheme because they felt that pink is a stereotypical, “outdated way of representing females.” While researching the start-up by looking at their social media accounts, the first iteration of our app was inspired by their brand centered on the color green; we decided to change it to pink to make it our own without fully considering its implications, as this user pointed out. In another iteration, we would consider different colors.
    </p> <p>
      When asked whether using this application made them think differently about their current methods of cycle tracking, all three of them indicated that using our app made some meaningful impact on them.  
    </p>
    <img src="sketches/question.png" alt="" class="image3">
    <p>
    These responses were incredibly rewarding to us as the developers. These results are in line with our expectations since we tried to make the app as intuitive as possible by following good design principles we learned in class and listening to our peers' feedback. 
  </p> <p>
The frustrations that users reported of being unable to read placeholder text and complete the quiz themselves (the choices were pre-filled in) tells us that the users found themselves genuinely interested in the subject matter, and wanted to fill out the quiz and read the blog. These were pieces that were unfortunately outside the scope of our app development. However, we hope that the users were motivated to do more research on their own after using our app, which we are inclined to believe based on their answer to feeling different about their cycle tracking.
</p> <p>
In summary, these results illustrated that a first time user would be able to navigate around the app and make use of its features quite easily. Users noted that the app was clear and simple to use. We could improve the app by allowing users to easily return to their quiz results so they don't have to complete the quiz again in order to see recommendations. We would also conduct more research to determine if our color scheme makes some users uncomfortable and change accordingly. In future iterations of user testing, we would either make sure that placeholder text is in English, or to be more sensitive to users who are not familiar with Lorem Ipsum text.
